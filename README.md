## Development

### Development Environment Setup

### Docker-related

Run project
`docker-compose up -d`

If you make any changes that requires a new Docker build:
`docker-compose up --build -d`

To run one-off processes on engine container, for example:
`docker-compose run api python api/manage.py makemigrations`

To scale up number of workers
`docker-compose up -d --scale worker=2`

To debug using pdb or ipdb
`docker attach {containerId}`

## First local deployment

For use the project you only need to apply migrations of the project, you need to run:
`docker-compose run api python api/manage.py migrate`

## Restoring a Data Base dump

If you have one or many databases, you only need to run the next command for restoring the data:
`docker-compose exec unit_blood pg_restore --verbose --clean --no-acl --no-owner -h db -U postgres -d postgres <file.dump>`

## Backup Data Base

When you want to backup the database, you only need to run:
`docker-compose exec unit_blood pg_dumpall -c -h db -U postgres> latest.dump`


# Final release

The first version belongs to Instituto Polit√©cnico Nacinal (IPN), while the idea and development belogs to Adrian Gonzalez, so he demands that deployment or use of his idea be attached in the credits and not be monetized.
